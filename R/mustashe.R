#' mustashe: Stash and Load Objects in R
#'
#' A simple system for saving and loading objects in R. Long running
#' computations can be stashed after the first run and then reloaded the next
#' time. Dependencies can be added to ensure that a computation is re-run if
#' any of its dependencies or inputs have changed.
